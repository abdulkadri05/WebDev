# ðŸŽ® Web Games â€“ HTML, CSS, JavaScript

This section of the repository contains simple games built using only **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript** (no frameworks or libraries).

Each project is focused on learning and practicing core front-end development skills like:
- DOM manipulation
- User interaction
- Game logic
- Basic animations and styling

More games will be added over time!
